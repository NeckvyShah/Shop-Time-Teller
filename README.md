# ShopTimeTeller

## This JavaScript program checks the schedule of a shop and determines its current status (open or closed) based on the current day and time. It also calculates the time until the shop opens or closes and provides information about the next open day if the shop is currently closed.

- Run the program using the following command:
  - for `phase1.js` : `node phase1.js`
  - for `phase2.js` : `node phase2.js`
  - for `phase3.js` : `node phase3.js`
